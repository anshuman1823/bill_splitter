🧾 Bill Splitter

Bill Splitter is a simple, OCR-powered app designed to make splitting long and complex bills—like grocery bills—between friends easy and fair.

🎯 Purpose

This app began as a fun side project to automate the tedious and error-prone process my friends and I went through every time we bought groceries together. Since many of the items were shared (but not equally, due to different preferences), a fair split wasn’t always straightforward.

⚙️ How It Works
	1.	Scan the Bill: Upload an image of your bill. The app uses OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to extract item details automatically.
	2.	Add People: Enter the names of the people involved in the purchase.
	3.	Assign Items: Select which person(s) each item belongs to—supporting both individual and shared items.
	4.	Split the Cost: The app calculates how much each person owes to the person who paid.
	5.	Export to Excel: An Excel file is generated in the backend containing all itemized splits and final amounts for easy review.

📦 Features
	•	🧠 Intelligent item extraction using OCR

🚧 Future Improvements (Optional)
